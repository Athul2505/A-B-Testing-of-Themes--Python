# A-B-Testing-of-Themes--Python

Many web platforms and applications perform A/B testing to run experiments to find the best design, layout, or themes for their platform. Instead of relying on assumptions or hunches, applications and websites can test different design variations on real-time users to measure their impact on user behaviour and metrics. By collecting and analyzing data, they can identify which design elements resonate most with users and optimize their offerings accordingly.


A/B Testing of Themes: Overview

A/B testing is a powerful and widely used Data Science technique to compare and evaluate marketing strategies, designs, layouts, or themes. The primary purpose of A/B testing is to make data-driven decisions that lead to improved user experiences, enhanced performance metrics, and ultimately better business outcomes.

Letâ€™s say we have two themes, dark mode and light mode. A company wants to understand which theme looks the best on its website.


To understand which theme is better, the company can set a light theme as the default theme of the website for a certain period and collect data on how users interact with the website. Likewise, they can set a dark theme as the default theme for the same period and compare the user interaction data of both themes to find which theme resulted in better user interaction, purchases, signups, longer session duration, and more.


So for the task of A/B testing of themes, we need to have a dataset of user interaction data on two themes or design templates. I found an ideal dataset for this task.


I have provided the entire code with proper explanation in the main Jupyter Notebook file. 


In summary, A/B testing is a powerful and widely used technique to compare and evaluate marketing strategies, designs, layouts, or themes. The primary purpose of A/B testing is to make data-driven decisions that lead to improved user experiences, enhanced performance metrics, and ultimately better business outcomes.
